# Tea Cozy Project
*A Project by Jeff Vergne*

This project is part of the **Fullstack Engineer Career** path from **CodeCademy**

## Objective
In this project, I am supposed to "fix" the styling of a website. HTML is provided and I am not supposed to touch it.
I guess the whole point here is to use the CSS media queries (and getting more and more familiar with CSS in general)
In order to know what to do, I followed this [specification document](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing.png).

## Technology
Written in HTML5 CSS3

## a few notes
